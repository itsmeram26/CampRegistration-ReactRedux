# Registration App build using React-Redux

To execute the program, first download the code and run the below command to Install all the dependencies listed within package.json in the local node_modules folder.
```
yarn install
```
Run the below command to start the Node server from the project directory. Why do we need Node Server? I have created a node server to serve the XHR Request. The response values are hard coded.

```
node src/server/server.js
```
Now run the below command to bring up the application and verify the same in localhost default port.
```
yarn dev-server
```
What was used to build the app?
---
1. React
2. Redux
3. Node JS
4. Bootstrap

I have made use of AXIOS for XHR calls to the Node server.
